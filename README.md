# Fundamentals CSS

This repository documents my journey learning HTML and CSS. I've been developing a method to learn and practice these languages effectively. While this method may not work for everyone, particularly those with different backgrounds, it's built from the perspective of a former designer pursuing a computer engineering degree.

Here's how you can use this repository:

Learn the fundamentals: Use resources like YouTube and W3Schools to grasp the core concepts of HTML and CSS.
Practice with the repository: Apply your newfound knowledge by working on the exercises or projects included here.
Review and refresh: Use this repository as a reference to revisit key HTML and CSS concepts whenever needed.
